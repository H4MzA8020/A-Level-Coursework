 There are 2 main unit types, infantry and cavalry. Infantry consists of heavy infantry and light infantry. Heavy infantry has high
 defence and melee damage, however, they suffer from a lack of mobility and ranged attack options. Furthermore, heavy infantry
 are also more well trained then their light counterparts, meaning they have a stronger base morale and organisation. Their
 presence alone boosts the morale of allied units nearby them. Heavy infantry include the Roman legionare and Carthiginian
 hoplites. The legionares can form into the infamous testudo formation, significantly boosting their defence, but slowing them .
 The hoplites can form a phalanx. which increases their range and defense, but also slows them down considerably. On the other hand,
 light infantry sacrifices armouur and weaponary for mobility, allowing them to move rapidly along the battlefield, harrasing
 the enemy infantry with their ranged weapons such as slingshots and javelins. This makes them adept for ambushing the enemy.
 Light infantry include the famous Balearic slingers, which are excellent at ranged skirmishes.

 Likewise, cavalry is also split into heavy and light sub-roles. Heavy cavalry has high damage, defence and morale damage,
 however they are much slower then light cavalry and can be encircled and destroyed if used incorrectly. Heavy cavalry include the
 Roman 'Ala', and the Carthiginian war elephants. They are best used as the hammer in hammer-and-anvil tactics. Light cavalry
 functions simmilary to light infantry, their main function is to weaken and harass the enemy using hit-and-run tactics. Their mobility
 and lack of armour makes them much more suited to this auxillary role in the battlefield. They also suffer less damage to their
 organisation when crossing uneven or rugged terrain. Examples of light infantry are the Numidian mercenary cavalry.
